I'm Mohamed Eletreby, aka Maverick, a dedicated red teamer with a passion for uncovering vulnerabilities and simulating adversarial threats. My journey through Hack The Box and various CTFs keeps me grounded in real-world challenges and offensive tactics. Iâ€™m captivated by the strategies and techniques used by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups and constantly seek to emulate their persistence and creativity in my work. Driven by a commitment to making security airtight, I continuously push the boundaries of what's possible in cybersecurity.
